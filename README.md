# openNetworkMeasurer

Hello! My name is José Maia, and this is the Android client I developed for the project in my Master's dissertation.

If you want to compile this, you should make sure your local maven repository has the things in the maven-stuff folder,
as there were some necessary changes to libraries I used in order to make this work.

The project is deployed at http://fedora-srv01.alunos.dcc.fc.up.pt/, although the servers have been spotty lately.
